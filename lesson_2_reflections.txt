What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository it is created a hidden Git directory, i.e., It is created a good place where my project
will be trucked, in other words I enable Git to be able to truck my files. 
I need to do it because Git starts that way, it is the first step to make possible the file trucking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is between working directory and the repository, is a previous step before the repository, it allows
to truck these files that will be committed together, to "keep on sight" the files for the next commit, it remembers you what you pretend
to do.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use as a bag where I put all files related to one logical change because could be more than one file per logical change. It allows the
chance of continue adding files.
