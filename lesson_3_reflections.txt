When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm working on the same project with other people.
When my work is very important or critical.
When I need data ubiquity to access to my documents from any place and any moment.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because nobody will choose better than me the moment and branch that I need to pull, it is safer and more organized.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is possible only inside GitHub (I use would it when I'll want to get, to my GitHub account, other's content that is in 
GitHub, probably, to modify it ), is GitHub clone only. 
Clone is possible inside a local repository and between remote and local repository (remote -> local)
(I would it use when I'll want to copy a repository to local repository, to work in my great computer). 
Branch is possible only inside a repository, not between different repositories.
(I use would it when I'll need to get, for example, different versions of my project or add new features)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is the opportunity to resolve conflicts that arise when the modifications that I have introduced collide with 
my co-worker's modifications.
